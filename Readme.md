i have created the project for gdsc
an habit tracker using localstorage of the device
extension used:-

1. font awsome
2. google- fonts
3. chart.js
4. progressbar.js
5. apexchart.js of heatmap

i tried to explain the code by the commment
it isx not that clear because of lack of time
i used templates on the online for progressbar, charts and iretated with the data

the habit tracker has option to switch and create multiple users and multiple habits

after any action that effect graphs to update the graph pls reload the page
